# update-prerelease-npm-version

A Github Action to update your node module version with a prerelease version.

This action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions users:

- generates a pre-release version string with a tag, the current date in YYYY-MM-DD, and the `sha` hash of the latest commit
  - for example if your current version is `1.2.3`, the pre-release tag is `pre`,the date is `2022-04-25` (April 25th, 2022 UTC), and the `sha` commit (first 8 characters) is `abcde123` the pre-release version will be `1.2.3-pre.2022-04-25.sha-abcde123`
- modifies your `package.json` **version** property with this generated pre-release version string
- adds a **prereleaseSha** property to your `package.json`. This contains the latest SHA commit of the repo prior to publishing
- outputs the generated pre-release version string into the `pre-release-version` output variable

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

**Basic:**

```yaml
steps:
- name: Update your package.json with an npm pre-release version
  id: pre-release-version
  uses: adobe/update-prerelease-npm-version@v1.0.0
  with:
    # if not specified, use the default "pre" (optional)
    pre-release-tag: 'mytag' 
    # if not specified, use the default "package.json" (optional)
    package-json-path: 'some/path/package.json'
    # if specified, it will find the dependencies in package.json and update with the dependencies-to-update-version-tag
    dependencies-to-update: semver,to-camel-case
    # the version tag to update the dependencies-to-update list with
    dependencies-to-update-version-tag: next
    # the package name to publish to (optional)
    package-name: @adobe/my-cli-next

# your package.json version should be transformed after the previous step
- run: cat package.json
# access the pre-release version output. output variable is "pre-release-version"
- run: echo ${{ steps.pre-release-version.outputs.pre-release-version }} 
# then you publish your package with this pre-release version, under a tag (say 'next' here)
- run: npm publish --tag next
```
